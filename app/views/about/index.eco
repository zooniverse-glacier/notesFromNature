<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>
  <img class="right" src="images/about/sernec.jpg">People have been collecting specimens from the natural world for centuries - minerals, plants, fungi and animals. Today, there are an estimated two billion specimens housed in natural history museums around the world! These biological collections document where species and populations exist now and where they existed decades and centuries before, so they hold irreplaceable information necessary for uncovering the patterns of changes in species distributions and ecosystem composition over time. Scientists use such data and information in order to address key environmental issues we are facing right now, such as the impacts of climate change and how diseases affect wildlife and humans.
</p>
<p>
  For the information held in these collections to be used to its full potential there must be better digital access to these data. Most natural history collections are housed in museum cabinets, where they are not easily available to citizens and researchers. Only a small fraction of all natural history specimens is available digitally over the Internet, while the vast majority remains locked away from view in an inflexible, limited format. The Notes from Nature transcription project is a citizen science platform built to address this problem by digitizing the world’s biological collections one record at a time!

<h3>People and Partners</h3>
<p>
  Multiple collections, containing specimens representing over 200 institutions, are currently involved with Notes from Nature. Meet some of the primary scientists, collaborators and developers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Kip Will, Rosemary Gillespie, Joanie Ball, Meghan Culpepper, Joyce Gross and Peter Oboyski at the University of California at Berkeley, who are key participants in the CalBug project. <a href="http://calbug.berkeley.edu/Overview.html">Calbug</a>, funded by the National Science Foundation, is a collaborative digitizing project that includes the nine major insect collections in California - the <a href="http://essig.berkeley.edu/">Essig Museum of Entomology</a> at UC Berkeley, the <a href="http://research.calacademy.org/ent">California Academy of Sciences</a>, the <a href="http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/plant/PPD/csca.html">California State Collection of Arthropods</a>, the <a href="http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/">Bohart Museum</a> at UC Davis, the <a href="http://entmuseum.ucr.edu/">Entomology Research Museum UC Riverside</a>, <a href="http://mnhc.ucsc.edu/">Museum of Natural History Collections at UC Santa Cruz</a>, <ahref="http://www.sdnhm.org/science/entomology/">San Diego Natural History Museum</ahref=>, <a href="http://www.sbnature.org/collections/invert/entom/ent01.htm">Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nhm.org/site/research-collections/entomology">LA County Museum</a>.  These collections are comprised of pinned insects with labels and are a prime example of the stunning diversity of insect life.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.neoninc.org/about/staff/michael-denslow">Michael Denslow</a> at NEON, <a href="http://biology.appstate.edu/faculty-staff/103">Zack Murrell</a> at Appalachian State University, and <a href="http://dmconsult.library.virginia.edu/aboutus/">Andrew Sallans</a> at University of Virginia, who are key participants in the <a href="http://www.sernec.org/">South Eastern Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC)</a> project. SERNEC is a collaborative collection from about 222 herbaria across the Southeastern United States, representing over 12 million plant specimens! Each specimen in Notes from Nature includes a herbarium sheet image, where you can see the dried plant mounted on the paper and labeled with species and habitat information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tim Conyers, Database Manager at the Natural History Museum of London (NHML). Tim is responsible for zoology digitization projects at NHML and the Museum’s collections management system. The NHML has digitized its bird ledgers, which is one of the world's richest collections of historical specimens, spanning over a hundred years and covering the globe!
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/robgur/">Rob Guralnick</a> and Aly Seeberger, from the <a href="http://cumuseum.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado Museum of Natural History</a>, who have provided test datasets in order to determine the cost, accuracy and speed of volunteer transcriptions compared to other methods, and helped test Notes from Nature.
  </li>
  <li>
    The teams from <a href="http://vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> and the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">Zooniverse</a> who helped create the look and feel of the project
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes from Nature and You</h3>
<p>
  <img class="right" src="images/about/calbug.jpg">Natural history museums across the world share a common goal – to make scientific data accessible to those who would use it. The Notes from Nature project gives you the opportunity to make a scientifically important contribution. Every transcription that is completed brings us closer to filling gaps in our knowledge of global biodiversity. Help museum staff and scientists by transcribing the labels and ledgers that have been meticulously recorded and stored for the very reason that they might be someday be useful. Join us in unlocking this important information - take some notes from nature!
</p>

<h3>How to become a participant in Notes from Nature</h3>
<p>
  Thanks for your interest in Notes from Nature! Below we provide some
  background on Notes from Nature and more about how we are planning to
  grow our pool of institutional participants. First and foremost, we ask for
  your patience. Notes from Nature has very limited capacity and resources
  that is already spread thinly to cover a lot of tasks.
</p>

<p>
  How did Notes from Nature (NfN) come to be? NfN was developed as part
  of Alfred P. Sloan funding support to the Citizen Science Alliance and the
  Zooniverse. Three different consortia of natural history collections put in
  separate proposals related to specimen transcription as part of a call for
  proposals for new Zooniverse projects. All three proposals were folded
  into one project, NfN. Many months of collaborative work between the
  science teams, Vizzuality and Zooniverse developers, led to the site we
  have today.
</p>

<p>
  This background is meant to be instructive. Notes from Nature does
  have a long term mission and support for operating costs. The partners
  involved want to see Notes from Nature thrive and grow, and we want
  you to be a part of it. Having said that, each additional partner presents
  both challenges and opportunities. We currently have limited capacity to
  develop new interfaces or make major changes to the site.
</p>

<p>
  Growing Notes from Nature needs to be done strategically and we have 
  developed a set of criteria for prioritizing how we can best proceed.  Those 
  criteria are as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Your collection can be transcribed using an interface similar to the ones 
    already developed for herbarium sheets and insect pins.  If you have a great 
    idea that requires a new interface, we still want to hear the idea and we 
    can discuss the ways to support developing that.
  </li>
  <li>
    You are willing to devote the time and energy needed to develop new
    content to the NfN blog for example, help transcribers via the excellent
    discussion boards that Notes from Nature runs, and deal with the shared
    responsibility of site management and data management. If there is a
    special case, such as an orphaned digital collection, etc. please contact us
    with more details!
  </li>
  <li>
    You can contribute resources to Notes from Nature that can support
    shared tasks that have been prioritized by the team. These resources
    can be available funding that could support management of the project,
    Zooniverse developers or it can be local programming or community
    support effort.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Notes from Nature has set up a Steering Committee (members listed at the
  bottom of this page) that helps guide prioritization and other issues related
  to Notes from Nature. If you want to collaborate with Notes from Nature
  down the road and plan to write us into grant proposals, please directly
  contact the committee Chair, Michael Denslow. We ask for a lead time of
  at least 4 weeks in order for us to be able to work with you to develop a
  winning strategy to writing Notes from Nature into your grant.
</p>

<p>
  Whether you are ready to become a participant, or want to coordinate
  becoming a participant in the future and write us into a proposal, please fill
  out the form below to start the process. We will make every attempt to
  get back to you as soon as possible after you have completed the form.
