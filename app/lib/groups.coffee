        <p>The Macrofungi Collection Consortium, funded by the National Science Foundation, is a partnership of 35 institutions across the U.S that collectively will digitize about 1.5 million specimens that have been collected the past 150 years.</p>
        <p>Macrofungi are important to humans in many ways – many people like to eat them, but some species are also deadly poisonous.  Macrofungi are also key to the health of our forests – indeed, most forest trees could not survive if their roots did not form a relationship with a macrofungus (called mycorrhizae) that helps tree roots absorb water and minerals from the soil.  Macrofungi are also an important source of food for forest animals and they serve as homes for many soil insects and other small organisms that are also part of a healthy forest ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Many macrofungi are very beautiful, and are the subject of nature photographers.  Their pigments may be used for dyeing wool or cotton, and for paper-making. Macrofungi are important religious symbols in some cultures.  Recently it has been discovered that macrofungi can play a role in the cleanup of environmental disasters.  Through a process called “mycoremediation” macrofungi are able to break down or remove contaminants such as pesticides and fuel oils.</p>

Here at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, our research collection of Crustacea (which includes the crabs) is one of the largest in the world, containing hundreds of thousands of specimens.  Because this collection has never been digitized, it is hard to use it efficiently to answer research questions. Unless we walk up to the shelves here at the Museum, we can’t tell you what species are in the collection, or where and when they were collected.  This subset of the collection includes crabs of the family Cancridae (the cancer crabs), and includes the popular (and edible) Rock Crabs and Dungeness Crab.  Many of our specimens are from the Eastern Pacific, but we have specimens from collecting expeditions all over the world.  These specimens, and the collection information about each of them, will contribute to research on crab evolution as well as research on how crab populations are changing through time in response to a changing world.  First, though, researchers around the world need to know what is in the collection. That’s where we need your help: to transcribe collecting information from specimen labels into a digitally searchable form."
