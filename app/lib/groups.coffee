      "description":"SERNEC is an organization that supports the 222 Herbaria and over 12 million plant specimen found in the Southeastern United States.  Each of these herbaria are valued collections of plants specimens used in research and teaching.  Their value is amplified in partnership and  SERNEC is devoted to making the resources of all these Herbaria available online as one virtual, researchable collection. SERNEC will improve access to specimen data of a richly biodiverse region, and provide a platform for herbarium curators and plant scientists to exchange ideas, share expertise, and benefit from the value of information shared across institutions."

      "description":"Calbug is an effort to digitize terrestrial arthropod specimen records with a focus on California. Using data from specimens the impacts of climate change and habitat modification will be examined. The project is a collaboration of eight entomological collections in California to digitize museum specimens and thus allow assessment of how species distributions have responded to environmental change. It makes use of a long history of entomological collecting in the region to develop a database of approximately 1 million georeferenced specimens collected over the last century."
      "snippet": "Calbug digitizes collections of pinned insect specimens drawn from eight of California's major institutions, showcasing the stunning diversity of insect life in our world."
